# GraphQL

The instructions for this task were to create a website that would display the user's 01 Intra profile and create custom graphs using the user's statistics. The graphs had to be made with SVG and the website had to be hosted.

# Deployed website

https://koodgraphql.netlify.app/

# Usage locally

To run the program at the default 8080 port, use `go run .`

If you wish to use a different port, you can add a valid port number as an argument.

Ex. `go run . 5000`

# Instructions

To use the website, log in with your 01 Intra credentials. The credentials will not be stored.

After logging in, you will be redirected to a page with your user information and 2 graphs.

# Testing

[Here](https://github.com/01-edu/public/tree/master/subjects/graphql/audit) are the audit questions to test the program.
